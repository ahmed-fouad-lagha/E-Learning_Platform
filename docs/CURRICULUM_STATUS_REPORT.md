- 3 major exams created: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry
- 3 sample questions per exam with detailed solutions
- Need to add more exams for other subjects

## Next Steps Priority:
1. **Complete Mathematics lessons** (highest priority for BAC prep)
2. **Complete Physics lessons** (second priority)
3. **Complete Chemistry lessons** (third priority)
4. **Expand Literature and Philosophy content**
5. **Complete Islamic Studies curriculum**
6. **Add more BAC-style exam questions and practice tests**

## Files Created:
- ✅ curriculum-courses.sql (21 courses)
- ✅ curriculum-lessons-part1.sql (5 math lessons)
- ✅ curriculum-lessons-part2.sql (5 lessons across subjects)
- ✅ curriculum-lessons-part3.sql (12 lessons across subjects)
- ✅ curriculum-lessons-part4.sql (6 lessons + exam prep)
- ✅ curriculum-exams.sql (BAC exam questions)

## Current Progress: 23/200+ lessons (11.5% complete)
**Recommendation: Focus on completing core mathematics and sciences first, then expand to literature and humanities for comprehensive BAC preparation.**
