## How to Test the Logout Button

### Step 1: Start Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Current Logout (Dashboard)
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/auth`
2. Log in with any existing account
3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
4. Look for the logout button in the dashboard (top right area)
5. Click it - you should be redirected to the home page

### Step 3: Test New Header Logout
1. After logging in, you should see a header at the top of every page
2. The header shows "Ù…Ø±Ø­Ø¨Ø§Ù‹ØŒ [your name]" and a logout button
3. Click the logout button - you should be redirected to `/auth`

### Step 4: Test Using Test Page
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/test-logout`
2. Follow the instructions on that page

## What the Logout Button Does

1. **Calls Supabase signOut()**: Properly signs out from Supabase
2. **Updates local state**: Clears user data from the auth context
3. **Redirects user**: Takes user back to auth page
4. **Refreshes page**: Ensures clean state

## Where You Can Find Logout Buttons

- âœ… **Dashboard page**: Existing logout button (top right)
- âœ… **Header**: New logout button on every page (when logged in)
- âœ… **Test page**: Dedicated test page at `/test-logout`

## Troubleshooting

If logout doesn't work:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Check if user is actually logged in** before testing
3. **Try the test page** at `/test-logout` for detailed debugging

## Next Steps

Now that logout is working, you can:
1. âœ… Test the logout functionality
2. ðŸ”„ Continue with Google OAuth setup (from our previous steps)
3. ðŸ”„ Test the complete auth flow (login â†’ dashboard â†’ logout)

The logout button is ready! Try it out and let me know how it works! ðŸš€
