- ✅ **Fixed:** Insufficient input validation on auth forms
- ✅ **Fixed:** Missing security headers (CSP, XSS protection)
- ✅ **Fixed:** Inadequate error handling exposing sensitive info

### 2. API Security
- ✅ **Fixed:** Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ✅ **Fixed:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization
- ✅ **Fixed:** Missing CSRF protection
- ✅ **Fixed:** Improper error responses leaking internal info

### 3. File Upload Security
- ✅ **Fixed:** Missing file type validation
- ✅ **Fixed:** Missing file size limits
- ✅ **Fixed:** Insufficient access control on file downloads

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues (Addressed)

### 1. Session Management
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added secure session handling
- ✅ **Fixed:** Implemented proper session invalidation
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added session activity logging

### 2. Data Validation
- ✅ **Fixed:** Comprehensive input validation schemas
- ✅ **Fixed:** SQL injection prevention
- ✅ **Fixed:** XSS prevention measures

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added security event logging
- ✅ **Fixed:** Rate limiting monitoring
- ✅ **Fixed:** Failed authentication tracking

## 🟢 Security Measures Implemented

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- Card redemption: 3 per hour
- File access: 100 per minute
- Password reset: 3 per hour
- Registration: 3 per hour
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
- Email validation with proper regex
- Password strength requirements
- File type and size validation
- Card code format validation
- SQL injection prevention
```

### Security Headers
```typescript
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content-Security-Policy: Strict policy
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
- Sanitized error messages in production
- No sensitive data exposure
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Security event logging
```

## 🛡️ Ongoing Security Measures

### 1. Monitoring
- Real-time rate limit monitoring
- Failed authentication tracking
