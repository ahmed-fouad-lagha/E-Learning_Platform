echo "‚úÖ CORRECT OAuth Flow:"
echo "1. User clicks Google Sign In"

echo "3. Supabase ‚Üí https://bacalgerie.me/auth/callback?code=..."

echo "1. GOOGLE OAUTH SETTINGS:"
echo "   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials"
echo "   - Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
echo "   - Authorized redirect URIs should ONLY be:"
echo "     https://tgmnzmmfjkwougqtgwif.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback"
echo "   - Remove any other URLs like bacalgerie.me"
echo ""

echo "2. SUPABASE SETTINGS:"

echo "   - Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration"
echo "   - Site URL: https://bacalgerie.me"
echo "   - Redirect URLs:"
echo "     https://bacalgerie.me/auth/callback"
echo "     http://localhost:3000/auth/callback"
echo ""

echo "3. VERIFY OAUTH PROVIDER:"
echo "   - In Supabase Dashboard"
echo "   - Authentication ‚Üí Providers"
echo "   - Check Google provider configuration"
echo "   - Make sure redirect URL is correct"
echo ""

echo "üí° IMPORTANT:"
echo "   - Google OAuth redirect should go to SUPABASE, not your app"
echo "   - Supabase then redirects to your app"
echo "   - Your app's callback route processes the final code"
